## ‚ö†Ô∏è CHALLENGES
**Data Availability**
- From 1280 job listings, only 23% (302 jobs listings) are advertised with salary ranges.
- From 1280 job listings, only 26% (338 job listings) mentioned specific tools required.

**Unstructured Job Description**
- Every job listings have unstandardized job description formats, making it difficult to extract relevant skills and qualifications. Further extensive text pre-processing is required. 

**Keyword Relevance**
- Results produced on the website may not always align with the intended keyword ('data analyst'). Towards end of the scraped pages, for example, some listings may include unrelated roles or ambiguous terms that may cause noises on the dataset. This may explain why some job listings had no mention of specific tools commonly required for analytics roles.
